# Century
Learning PowerShell. I learned bash using [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) and I am really glad there is a similar platform for PowerShell. 
[UnderTheWire](https://underthewire.tech/) is OverTheWire counterpart. I'll be loggin what I do to solve these problems. 

## Century1

The password for Century2 is the build version of the instance of PowerShell installed on this system.

## Century2
```
The password for Century3 is the name of the built-in cmdlet that performs the wget like function within PowerShell PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.
```
Looking at cmdlets, the **Invoke-WebRequest** seems like the command to use. The file is 443 thus: **invoke-webrequest443** gives me the credentials to Century3.

## Century3
```
The password for Century4 is the number of files on the desktop.
```
Quick Googling shows two cmdlets. The first is **Get-ChildItem** which is similar to the ls command on Linux. We can pipe this cmdlet into the **Measure-Object** cmdlet.
```ps1
(Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object)

Count    : 123

## Century4
```
The password for Century5 is the name of the file within a directory on the desktop that has spaces in its name.
```
This was a pretty simple one as it is very similar to Linux.
```ps1
cd ".\Can You Open Me"
```
The file is **5548**.

## Century5
```
The password for Century6 is the short name of the domain in which this system resides in PLUS the name of the file on the desktop.
```
First, the file on the Desktop is **3347**.
Using the **Get-WmiObject** cmdlet with the Class Win32_NTDomain gives the domain name.
```ps1
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NTDomain

ClientSiteName          : Default-First-Site-Name

```
The Get-WmiObject (Windows Management Instrumentation) gets instances of WMI classes or information about the available classes. The Win32_NTDomain class represents the a Windows domain.

## Century6
```
The password for Century7 is the number of folders on the desktop.
```
This was similar to Century3
```ps1

## Century7
```
The password for Century8 is in a readme file somewhere within the contacts, desktop, documents, downloads, favorites, music, or videos folder in the userâ€™s profile.
```
**Get-ChildItem** cmdlet seems to be a 'roided version of ls.
```ps1
