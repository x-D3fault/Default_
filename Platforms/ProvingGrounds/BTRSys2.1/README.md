I ran a Gobuster scan:

```bash

There is also a Wordpress application. I run a few scans against it.

```bash

## Exploitation
Trying to look at /upload returns an error saying that there is no database named 'Lepton'. A quick google search shows that Lepton is a CMS. This seems to be a rabbit hole though. I seems as if the CMS was not entirely set up or configured improperly. 

I turn my attention to Wordpress. My initial enumeration doesn't yield anything that could help me. I rerun a password scan against the Wordpress site:

```bash
wpscan --url http://192.168.56.50/wordpress/ -t 40 -e u1-1000 --passwords /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force -o wp/password.wp
```

Which shows that the credentials for admin is **admin:admin**. Logging into the Wordpress site always us to modify pages by injecting my own code. I go to Appearance > Editor > 404.php and replace the code with a php-reverse-shell.

Set up a listener using **nc -lnvp 1337** and using curl to hit the website 

```bash
curl http://192.168.56.50/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfourteen/404.php
```

Gives a reverse shell.

## Privilege Escalation
I start my privilege escalation by first running LinEnum.sh. This shows that the www-data user has a .bash_history file in /var/www. Reading over .bash_history shows that the previous user logged into the MySQL server using the credentials **root:rootpassword!**. They then use the wordpress database to dump all entries in the wp_users table. 

I do exactly the same and dumped the hashes for two users: admin and btrisk. We already known admins password. I throw btrisk's password into crackstation and get the credentials **btrisk:roottoor**. I use these credentials to pivot to btrisk.

Lastly, running **sudo -l** shows that btrisk can run any command as sudo. I use **sudo -i** and escalate to root.
