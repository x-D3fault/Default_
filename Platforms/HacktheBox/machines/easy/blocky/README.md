Becuase there is a HTTP server, I run Nikto and a directory buster
```bash

Taking a look at the actual site, it seems to be a wordpress site. So I also run wpscan
```bash
wpscan --url http://10.10.10.37/ -e ap,at,u --plugins-detection aggressive -f cli-no-color -o wp/blocky.wp

## Exploitation
This box actually teaches how to enumerate a wordpress web application pretty well. Wordpress is full of directories and subdirectories. If you do it incorrectly, you may end up with a whole bunch of nothing. When scanning with dirbuster, only looking at directories gives you quality results. Through directory busting, I find /plugins/files/BlockyCore.jar. Downloading this file and decompressing it gives a file BlockyCore.class. Decompiling this file gives:
```java
package com.myfirstplugin;

public class BlockyCore
{
    public String sqlHost;
    public String sqlUser;
    public String sqlPass;
    
    public BlockyCore() {
        this.sqlHost = "localhost";
        this.sqlUser = "root";
        this.sqlPass = "8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22";
    }
    
    public void onServerStart() {
    }
    
    public void onServerStop() {
    }
    
    public void onPlayerJoin() {
        this.sendMessage("TODO get username", "Welcome to the BlockyCraft!!!!!!!");
    }
    
    public void sendMessage(final String username, final String message) {
    }
}
```
Which exposes a password for phpmyadmin. I accessed phpmyadmin and found one user in the wp_user table with the username notch and a password hash of $P$BiVoTj899ItS1EZnMhqeqVbrZI4Oq0/. I tried for so long to crack this password but couldn't. So I used the exposed password with notch to SSH in. This gives you foothold.

## Privilege Escalation
The privilege escalation for this box was very straight forward. If you use:
```bash
sudo -l

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```
Which means you can use sudo -i and instantly get root shell.
